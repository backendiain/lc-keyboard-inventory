# Overview
A simple mod that rebinds the top number keys 1-4 to change the currently held item to one of the inventory slots (1-4).

I really only made this as a quick way to tinker in LC and Unity. There are no doubt better ways to do even what little I've done here.

For example, I'm using Unity's legacy input system because LC uses it as of 2023/12/22.

# Next Steps
Add a key bindings menu for the mod where you can reset the key bindings to whatever works for you.

# Special Thanks
I just flat out missed some of the private methods in dotPeek of PlayerControllerB I could call to achieve the item switches.

The [ItemQuickSwitchMod](https://github.com/vasanex/ItemQuickSwitchMod) by vasanex enlightened me on how best to achieve this so special thanks to him.

The [LethalCompanyGameMaster](https://github.com/lawrencea13/LethalCompanyGameMaster) repo lawrencea13 was also beneficial.
